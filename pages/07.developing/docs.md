GLAMpipe is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application. It uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb) as a document database.

The source code of GLAMpipe is in github: [https://github.com/artturimatias/GLAMpipe](https://github.com/artturimatias/GLAMpipe)

You should make a native [installation](http://glampipe.org/installation) for development purposes. It requires that you install MongoDB, Node.js and npm in your computer.
