### Get GLAMpipe
To get started, you need access to GLAMpipe. You have two options:
1. If you only work with data, it is possible to use the [online version](http://glampipe.org:3000). File uploads are also becoming usable with the online tool.
2. If you want to upload media, you will need to install the software on your computer. GLAMpipe is a node.js application and it uses MongoDB for data storage. The easiest way is to use Docker-compose with Docker. The setup supports a variety of platforms. Another option is to install the software natively, which is required for older Macs. See the instructions on the following pages.
