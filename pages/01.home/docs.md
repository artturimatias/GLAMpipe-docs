 **GLAMpipe** is an extensible, open source web-application intended for cultural metadata manipulation. 
 
 ! NOTE: GLAMpipe is currently under development and it is not production ready.
 
 The workflow of GLAMpipe is based on **documents and nodes** instead of rows and cells. 
 
 Nodes are like building blocks of data flow. They can act as a data source, they can split, combine, create wikitext or process data other ways, and nodes can export data to files or web services 
 like Wikimedia Commons or Wikidata.
 
 GLAMpipe can be used to: 
- process metadata + files
- browse metadata 
- download metadata + files 
- upload metadata + files
