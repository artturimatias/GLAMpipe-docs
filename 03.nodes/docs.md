title: Nodes

Nodes are the "pipe" part of the GLAMpipe. Nodes are building blocks that do one thing for data. 

GLAMpipe uses nodes for workflow management. By putting nodes in series one can make all kind of transforms of data. 

There are four groups of nodes:
* import
* process
* download
* export
* view

With nodes it is possible to make "easy to follow" structure for all editing that is needed for a dataset.
